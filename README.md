# TT1
Our Google Docs clone, called "TypeTogether" is a full stack web application that allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents in real time. It is built using React on the frontend, and Spring Boot on the backend, with a SQL database for storing user and document data. The app includes a document library that allows both logged-in and non-logged-in users to view a list of all available documents, as well as view a specific document. For logged-in users, the app also provides the ability to create new documents that can consist of text and images, upload and download documents to and from their "desktop." The app also includes a search function that allows users to filter the list of documents by a search term.

### Technologies:

Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, TinyMCE text editor

Backend: Spring Boot, Java
Database: MySQL

TypeTogether is a powerful and feature-rich web application, a scalable tool for teams and individuals looking to collaborate on documents.33
